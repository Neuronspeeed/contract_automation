# TODOs for Implementing Sophisticated Workflow Control

## 1. Design Workflow Structure
- [ ] Define discrete steps in the contract creation pipeline
- [ ] Create a flowchart or diagram of the workflow
- [ ] Identify state transitions between steps
- [ ] Determine data requirements for each step

## 2. Implement Workflow Framework
- [ ] Choose a workflow engine (e.g., Apache Airflow, Prefect, or custom solution)
- [ ] Set up the chosen workflow framework in the project
- [ ] Define workflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) structure

## 3. Create Workflow Nodes
- [ ] Implement individual nodes for each step in the workflow
- [ ] Ensure each node has clear input and output definitions
- [ ] Add error handling and logging to each node

## 4. Implement State Management
- [ ] Design a state management system (e.g., using a database or in-memory store)
- [ ] Implement functions to update and retrieve workflow state
- [ ] Ensure state persistence across system restarts

## 5. Data Flow Control
- [ ] Implement mechanisms to pass data between workflow nodes
- [ ] Ensure data integrity and type checking between steps
- [ ] Implement data versioning if required

## 6. Conditional Logic and Branching
- [ ] Add support for conditional execution of workflow steps
- [ ] Implement branching logic based on step outcomes or external factors

## 7. Checkpointing
- [ ] Implement checkpointing mechanism to save progress at key points
- [ ] Ensure ability to resume workflow from checkpoints

## 8. Monitoring and Visualization
- [ ] Implement a system to monitor workflow progress
- [ ] Create visualizations of workflow state and progress
- [ ] Set up alerts for workflow failures or delays

## 9. Testing
- [ ] Develop unit tests for individual workflow nodes
- [ ] Create integration tests for the entire workflow
- [ ] Implement stress tests to ensure scalability

## 10. Documentation
- [ ] Document the overall workflow architecture
- [ ] Create detailed documentation for each workflow step
- [ ] Provide examples and usage guidelines for the workflow system

## 11. Optimization and Performance
- [ ] Identify and optimize bottlenecks in the workflow
- [ ] Implement parallel execution where possible
- [ ] Add caching mechanisms to improve performance

## 12. Security and Access Control
- [ ] Implement access controls for different parts of the workflow
- [ ] Ensure data security throughout the workflow process
- [ ] Add audit logging for all workflow actions

## 13. Integration
- [ ] Integrate the workflow system with existing project components
- [ ] Ensure compatibility with current data models and APIs
- [ ] Update main application to use the new workflow system

## 14. User Interface (if applicable)
- [ ] Design a user interface for workflow management
- [ ] Implement features to start, stop, and monitor workflows
- [ ] Create visualizations of workflow progress and results

## 15. Deployment and Scaling
- [ ] Set up deployment pipeline for the workflow system
- [ ] Implement scaling mechanisms for handling multiple workflows
- [ ] Ensure proper resource allocation and management
